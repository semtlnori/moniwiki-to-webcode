If you are coming to this page for the first time, you'll see form into which you can enter your username and some other settings (crypted password and e-mail are stored). If you click on **Create Profile**, a user profile will be created for you. With the response, a HTTP cookie will be sent that contains your user ID, which enables the system to recognize you. 

**Logout** clears the cookie. As described above, **Login** enables you to gain access to your user profile if you somehow lost the cookie or are on another machine. **Save** just updates your profile.
